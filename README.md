# Wolney Oliveira

I'm [Wolney](https://wolney.dev/), a full-stack developer based in Brazil.

I coded my first app when I was 17 years old during the 2020 pandemic.

The best thing about computing is the freedom of getting ideas and making them real.

My current main stack is Node.js, but the best tool is the one that best fits the use case.

I've build apps using Java, Python, C/C++, Scala, Go, Rust, and Node.js.

Fun fact: I love motorsport 🏎️
